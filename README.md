This is the application.


There is 2 aplications that must be running on the same time. 

index.js in the root is for service API to FrontEnd.
index.js in folder 'app' is used for cronjob for sending email.

This project use mysql as Database. I also have a plan to use cache (redis) and (RabbitMQ). But its too complex if I do it alone. So i only gave the simplest.


This project is not done yet because i have no enough time to complete it. If I have a chance to join your company, I will complete this correctly.
